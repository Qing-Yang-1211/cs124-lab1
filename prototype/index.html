        <h2>The empty list</h2>
        <div class="iframe-paragraph-row">
            <iframe src="empty-list.html" height="400" width="250" title="Empty list"></iframe>
            <p>This demonstrates an empty to-do list with no items. The input field at the bottom allows the user to
            enter the name of an item and click on the "plus" button to add a new item. All the finished items will be hidden
                when the user clicks on the "Hide Finished" button at the top, and all the finished items will be
                deleted when the user clicks on the "Delete Finished" button at the top.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>After creating a new item in empty list</h2>
        <div class="iframe-paragraph-row">
            <iframe src="buy-john-grisham.html" height="400" width="250" title="New item in empty list"></iframe>
            <p>This shows the page after the user entered "Buy new John Grisham book" in the input field at the bottom
            and clicked the "plus" button. A new item named "Buy new John Grisham book" has appeared as the first row
            and the only row on the to-do list. This item will be marked as complete if the user checks the checkbox
                associated with it. It will be removed if the user clicks on the "trash" sign, and the user can rename
                this item by clicking on the "pencil" sign. Currently, the to-do list is not empty and we will create
                a new item in this non-empty list.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>After creating a new item in non-empty list</h2>
        <div class="iframe-paragraph-row">
            <iframe src="eat-lunch.html" height="400" width="250" title="New item in non-empty list"></iframe>
            <p>This page exists after the user creates a new item named "Eat Lunch" in the non-empty list by entering
                "Eat Lunch" in the input field at the bottom and clicking the "plus" button besides it.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Before marking "Call Mom" completed</h2>
        <div class="iframe-paragraph-row">
            <iframe src="call-mom-uncomplete.html" height="400" width="250" title="Before marking Call Mom complete"></iframe>
            <p>This shows the to-do list with three items, including the "Call Mom" item. In the next step,
                we are going to mark the "Call Mom" item as completed.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>After marking "Call Mom" completed</h2>
        <div class="iframe-paragraph-row">
            <iframe src="call-mom-complete.html" height="400" width="250" title="After marking Call Mom complete"></iframe>
            <p>This is the page after the user marked the "Call Mom" item as completed. The user marked the item by
                checking the checkbox before the "Call Mom" text. The background color of the row containing this item
                changed to a light green color, indicating that this item is completed.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Before renaming an item</h2>
        <div class="iframe-paragraph-row">
            <iframe src="text-john.html" height="400" width="250" title="Before renaming an item"></iframe>
            <p>This is the page after the user created a "Text John" item. Notice that all the unfinished items are
                shown above all the finished items and items are in the same order as they were created. In the
                next step, we are going to rename the "Text John" item to "Text John about bank statements".</p>
        </div>

        <h2>After renaming an item</h2>
        <div class="iframe-paragraph-row">
            <iframe src="text-john-abt-bank.html" height="400" width="250" title="After renaming an item"></iframe>
            <p>This is the page after the user has renamed the "Text John" item to "Text John about bank statements" by
                clicking on the "pencil" sign, deleting the old name and entering the new name.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Show only uncompleted items</h2>
        <div class="iframe-paragraph-row">
            <iframe src="only-unfinished.html" height="400" width="250" title="Only unfinished items"></iframe>
            <p>This is the page after the user clicked the "Hide Finished" button. The "Hide Finished" button has
                changed to "Show Finished" button and all the completed items are hidden from view. Clicking on the
                "Show Finished" button on this page will bring back the finished items to be shown below the unfinished
                items. </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Before deleting all completed items</h2>
        <div class="iframe-paragraph-row">
            <iframe src="text-john-abt-bank.html" height="400" width="250" title="Before deleting all completed items"></iframe>
            <p>This is the page showing a to-do list with both uncompleted items and completed items. Next, we are
                going to delete all the completed items by clicking on the "Delete Finished" button. </p>
        </div>

        <h2>After deleting all completed items</h2>
        <div class="iframe-paragraph-row">
            <iframe src="delete-finished.html" height="400" width="250" title="After deleting all completed items"></iframe>
            <p>This is the page after the user clicked the "Delete Finished" button. The completed item, "Call Mom",
                has been removed from the to-do list.</p>
